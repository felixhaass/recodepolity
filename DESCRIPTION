Description: The package downloads and recodes Polity IV and Polity2 scores according to Vreeland (2008) and Pluemper and Neumayer (2010). It fixes Polity IV's "contaminated"
   components that code conflict (which makes the Polity IV problematic to use in conflict analyses, see Vreeland
   2008). The package also recodes Polity's interregnum and interregnum-with-transition years that lack face validity
   in Polity's original coding (Pluemper and Neumayer 2010). Since the package dynamically downloads Polity it
   can be used to recode the latest annual publication of the Polity data.
